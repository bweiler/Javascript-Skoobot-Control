#Skoobot Raspberry Pi Javascript Command and Data Program

NOTE: I stopped developing this because users want Python, but maybe this code can be extended by someone who wants Javascript.

To get working:

1. Install node.js
   Once "node -v" and "npm -v" works you are good. My Raspberry
   Pi 3 wanted the arm7 version of node.js
2. Install noble "npm install noble"
3. Download skoobot.js and run it like this:

   sudo node skoobot.js
   
4. Check out comments in skoobot.js.
